To use a stepper motor in Dosis, you need to use 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor 5v with ULN2003 driver. In Dosis interface you need to typeWriting:


PasoArduino()

next outPin1,outPin2,outPin3,outPin4,inAnalogPin,state,velocity


//int outPin => 4 digital pin connect to Stepper on Arduino Board

//int inAnalogPin => 1 analog pin connect to push button 

//int state => 4 states, since 0 to 3, each state generate the direction of the motor rotation.

//int velocity => the velocity is from 3 to 11, the rotaion is slowly 


state=0 (stop stepper motor)

state=1 (right direction of the rotation and when push button is pressed stop stepper motor)

state=2 (left direction of the rotation and when push button is pressed stop stepper motor)

state=3 (rotate all the tiem on one direction and when push button is pressed, the direction of the rotation change)
