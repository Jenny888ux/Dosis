To use a servo motor in Dosis, you need to typeWriting in Dosis interface

servoArduino(outPin,ptoIn,state,ang,timeWait)

//outPin => Arduino pin, conected to servo
//int ptoIn => Initial point of the round
//int state => 6 states, since 0 to 5, each state produce differents types of round
//int ang => angle of rotation. The angle is used when the state is 2, 3 o 4 
//int timeWait => milliseconds time in each round movement. The timeWait is used when the state is 2 or 3

To use Servo Motor with Dosis interface, The servo motor are conected in pin: pin 2,4,7,8,12 or 13, never in PWM pins.
