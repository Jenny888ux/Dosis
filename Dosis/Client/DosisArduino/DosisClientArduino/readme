To use Arduino with Dosis Interface, open code and modify the port that you connect Arduino
int portArduino = 0; 

This variable is used in
arduino = new Arduino(this, Arduino.list()[portArduino], 57600);
  
Run DosisClientArduino and typeWriting on interface:

OnceArduino() => to send data to Arduino, and Arduino once turn on the pins that you typeWitre after you put this code. 

LoopArduino() => send repeatedly data to Arduino, and Arduino turn on the pins that you typeWitre after you put this code.

PararArduino() => stop sending data to Arduino.

Teclado() => turn on the pins that ehr user typewrite on the keyboard

To use Relay with Dosis Interface, you need conect the positive wire in C (Common Pin) and in NC (normally connected) into relay
