To use Arduino with Dosis Interface, you need to typeWriting

onceArduino() => to send data to Arduino, and Arduino once turn on the pins that you typeWitre after you put this code. 

loopArduino() => send repeatedly data to Arduino, and Arduino turn on the pins that you typeWitre after you put this code.

pararLoopArduino() => stop sending data to Arduino.


To use Relay with Dosis Interface, you need conect the positive wire in C (Common Pin) and in NC (normally connected) into relay
